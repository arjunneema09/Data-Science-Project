This is a DATA SCIENCE project where i have worked on the dataset which contained the details of players playing in the NBA over the course of years. First I loaded the dataset and cleaned it. Then i performed EDA and plotted some graphs and visuals to understand the relationship between differnt features of the dataset. Then i performed feture selection techniques to determine which onw works the best with this dataset and also making a prediction model using Lasso Regression .







NBA.R --> loading the dataset and data cleaning 




NBA2.R --> EDA - points distribution and Density Plot of Assist 




NBA3.R --> correlation matrix 




NBA5.R --> Scatter plot of points assists by team




NBA6.R --> Boxplot of Rebounds by Height Category 



NBA7.R --> Voilin Plot of Rebounds By Height 



NBA8.R --> Relationship Between Draft Number And Points 



NBA9.R --> Relationship Between true shooting percentage and points 



NBA10.R --> Feature selection by high correlation 



NBA11.R --> Feature Selection by RFE 



NBA12.R --> Feature Selection and point prediction by Lasso Regression
